# Introduction üåä

Welcome to the [Ultralytics WAVE repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/wave)! Here you will find innovative **W**aveform **A**nalysis **V**ia **E**ducation (WAVE) code, a cutting-edge approach for detector readout and data reconstruction in particle physics. Utilizing state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), our methods aim to enhance the precision and efficiency of time-of-flight measurements.

The significance of this work extends beyond the realm of physics into various fields where waveform data is crucial. Stay tuned as we explore the potentials of this exciting technology together!

# Requirements üìã

Ensure that you have Python 3.7 or later on your system. Begin by installing the necessary dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
```

In your `requirements.txt` file, you'll need the following libraries:

- `numpy`: For handling numerical data efficiently.
- `scipy`: For scientific and technical computing.
- `torch` >= 0.4.0: PyTorch deep learning framework.
- `tensorflow` >= 1.8.0: TensorFlow ML platform.
- `plotly`: Optional, for creating interactive plots.

# Run üöÄ

Here's how to run the WAVE models:

- WAVE in PyTorch:
  ```bash
  python wave_pytorch.py
  ```
- WAVE in TensorFlow:
  ```bash
  python wave_tf.py
  ```

If you're interested in deploying on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), utilize:
- WAVE in PyTorch on GCP:
  ```bash
  python gcp/wave_pytorch_gcp.py
  ```

Visualize the waveforms and training process through these plots:
