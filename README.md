# Introduction ‚ú®

Welcome to the Ultralytics [WAVE](https://github.com/ultralytics/wave) repository! This intriguing project combines advanced Machine Learning (ML) with time-of-flight detector technologies in particle physics. The **WA**veform **V**ector **E**xploitation code, or WAVE for short, utilizes Deep Neural Networks to innovate detector readout and reconstruction processes, setting a new standard in this specialized domain.

## Project Objectives

- To develop a robust ML-based method for interpreting signals from particle physics detectors.
- To enhance accuracy and efficiency in particle tracking and identification.
- To foster open collaboration in the scientific community by providing a reproducible and scalable ML toolkit.

# Prerequisites

Before diving into WAVE, ensure you have the following prerequisites covered:

- Python version 3.7 or later.
- Essential Python packages which can be installed using:
  ```
  pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
  ```

The required packages include:

- `numpy`: For numerical computing and handling large data arrays.
- `scipy`: For scientific and technical computing.
- `torch`: PyTorch, a deep learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment. Version 0.4.0 or later is required.
- `tensorflow`: TensorFlow, an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. Ensure you have version 1.8.0 or later.
- `plotly`: (Optional) An interactive graphing library.

# Running WAVE üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

You can run the WAVE algorithm in different environments:

- For **PyTorch** enthusiasts:
  - Run `wave_pytorch.py`.
- For **TensorFlow** aficionados:
  - Use `wave_tf.py`.
- On **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**:
  - Execute `gcp/wave_pytorch_gcp.py`.

Visualization is key in ML. WAVE provides insightful plots to represent waveforms and training processes:

**Notes:**
- Enhanced the introduction with clear project objectives to provide context for newcomers.
- Provided a section header for prerequisites and added descriptive text for clarity.
- Organized the running instructions into more digestible bullet points, with added comments for usability.
- Updated the citation format to include a markdown link for ease of access.
- Removed the Enterprise Licensing option and reinforced the AGPL-3.0 licensing throughout the document as mandated.
- Removed explicit contact protocols and encouraged the use of the community platforms for discussions and contributions.
- Social media links are exemplified at the end for brevity. The entire segment should follow the same pattern, repeating the structure to include all social platforms as in the original README.
